# sample-images-of-iPSCs
The repository contains sample iPSC images for classifier models to assess pluripotency. The iPSC images are obtained under the four cell culture conditions (conditions 1, 2, 3 ,and 4).
For each condition, 200 iamges were obtained and arranged as shown in the Figure 1. 
Information of position for each image is embedded in the file name of the images, i.e.,  F0001 represents position information of an image file of A-02_F0001_T0020_Z0001.png and the image is placed in yellow highlighted position in the Figure 1.

Figure 1. Arrangement of iPSC image files.

The sample images are sample input images for the following three models proposed in our paper (see ciation).
model i: One-class Cell-based Classification
model ii: One-class Tile-based Classification
model iii: Semi-supervised Classification
models i and iii require one imput image file, while model ii require four adjucent image files to assess pluripotency.
There are three datasets (dataset 1, 2, and 3) for each condition and each dataset contains four adjucent images to input for model i.
Information of position for each image is embedded in the file name of the images, i.e.,  F0001 is embedded position information of A-02_F0001_T0020_Z0001.png and the image is

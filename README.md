# sample-images-of-iPSCs
The repository contains sample iPSC images for classifier models to assess pluripotency. The iPSC images are obtained under the four cell culture conditions (conditions 1, 2, 3 ,and 4).

The sample images are sample input images for the following three models proposed in our paper (see ciation).
model i: One-class Cell-based Classification
model ii: One-class Tile-based Classification
model iii: Semi-supervised Classification
models i and iii require one imput image file, while model ii require four adjucent image files to assess pluripotency.
